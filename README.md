# Svelte + Vite + Tailwind

This template should help get you started developing with Svelte with Tailwind in Vite.

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd template-vite-svelte-tailwind
npm install
```

...then start [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and the changes should happen automatically to the page, with Hot Module Replacement supported by default.

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we recommend installing the following extensions [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode), [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss), [PostCSS Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=csstools.postcss)

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```
